# TitanicApp
The titanic app

The TitanicApp takes the Kaggle public dataset "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"

[a link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

Uses the most relevant columns to make a classification model for predicting either survival or death of the passenger,
depending of the characteristics introduced by the user.

For using the TitanicApp you must wait a little for the model to be trained (this may take a couple of minutes).

After the first message appear, try playing with the characteristics such as age or gender and press "Sumbmit" to see if this new
person will either survived or perish in the Titanic catastrophe.
